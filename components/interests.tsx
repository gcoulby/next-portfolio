          <p>
            I am passionate about design, and I love all aspects of development from embedded systems to front-end development and have a particular
            love for React/Next and use it on most of my projects. Aside to my professional skills I am also interested in graphic design, music
            production, 3D modelling, video & tabletop gaming, electronics, retro computing, and games development. I have a keen interest in virtual
            reality, and I am familiar with Unity, Unreal and PICO-8 game engines. I am highly interested in embedded systems e.g., FPGA / Arduino /
            Raspberry Pi development. The latter skills, coupled with my experience working with architects and BIM, are what inspired me to begin
            researching IoT technologies.
